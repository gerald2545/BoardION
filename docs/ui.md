# BoardION web interface

BoardION's interface is composed of 3 pages:
- Runs in progress: displays runs that are currently sequenced
- Sequencing overview: shows final metrics of all run and allows you to compare them
- Run: more informations and plots on a selected run

## Runs in progress view

This page show for each run currently sequenced 2 graphs:
- the yield over time
- the read length distribution

Each run is displayed in a separate box which can be expended/reduced using the '+'/'-' in the top right corner.

> the more boxes you open, the longer it'll take to refresh the data, as there is more graph to draw.

Between the table and the first run, there is a toggle button. This button is used for switch between cumulative and non-cumualative mode for the yield graph.
