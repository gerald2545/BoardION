# BoardION

BoardION is an interactive web application for real time monitoring of ONT sequencing runs. It provides the possibility for sequencing platforms to remotely monitor their ONT sequencing devices. The interactive interface of BoardION allows users to explore easily sequencing metrics in order to optimize reactively the quantity and the quality of the generated data. It also enables the comparison of multiple flowcells to assess the library preparations or the quality of samples.

A demo of BoardION is available [here](www.genoscope.cns.fr/boardion/demo).
